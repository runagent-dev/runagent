> RunAgent Cloud provides a fully managed, serverless infrastructure for deploying and running your AI agents. No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, and global availability.

## What is RunAgent Cloud?

RunAgent Cloud is a serverless platform designed specifically for AI agents. It handles all the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on building great agents.

### Key Benefits

## Serverless Infrastructure

RunAgent Cloud operates on a serverless model where:

- **No servers to manage** - Infrastructure is fully managed by RunAgent
- **Pay per use** - Only pay for actual agent execution time
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles traffic spikes without configuration
- **Zero maintenance** - Updates, patches, and security handled automatically
- **High availability** - Built-in redundancy and failover

### How It Works

1. **Deploy your agent** - Upload your agent code with a single command
2. **Automatic provisioning** - RunAgent Cloud selects the optimal VM image
3. **On-demand execution** - Agents start when needed, scale automatically
4. **Global distribution** - Requests routed to nearest available instance

## VM Image Management

RunAgent Cloud supports multiple VM images optimized for different use cases and dependencies.

### Automatic Image Selection

The platform automatically selects the appropriate VM image based on:

- **Framework requirements** - LangGraph, CrewAI, custom frameworks
- **Dependencies** - Python packages, system libraries
- **Resource needs** - CPU, memory, GPU requirements
- **Optimization** - Best performance for your specific agent

You don't need to specify which image to use - RunAgent Cloud handles this automatically.

### Deployment Time

Initial deployment time varies based on the selected VM image:

- **Standard images**: Typically ready in 30-60 seconds
- **Specialized images**: May take up to 2 minutes for first deployment
- **Subsequent requests**: Cached images start in seconds

The platform optimizes for your agent's specific needs, which may require pulling specialized images on first deployment.

### Image Availability

RunAgent Cloud currently supports multiple VM images optimized for:

- Python-based agents with various framework requirements
- Different dependency sets and system library needs
- Performance-optimized configurations

**More VM images coming soon** - We're continuously expanding image support to cover additional frameworks, languages, and use cases.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with RunAgent Cloud
runagent setup --api-key <your-api-key>

# 2. Deploy your agent
runagent deploy --folder ./my-agent

# 3. Your agent is live and accessible globally
```
