description: 'Deploy agent to production or local environment'
---

## Synopsis

```bash
runagent deploy [PATH] [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `deploy` command packages and deploys your agent either locally with persistence or to RunAgent's cloud infrastructure (coming soon).

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--local`, `-l` | Deploy locally | `false` |
| `--name`, `-n` | Deployment name | From config |
| `--env`, `-e` | Environment | `production` |
| `--no-validate` | Skip validation | `false` |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be deployed | `false` |

## Examples

### Local Deployment

```bash
# Deploy locally
runagent deploy . --local

# Deploy with custom name
runagent deploy . --local --name my-test-agent

# Dry run to see what would happen
runagent deploy . --dry-run
```

### Cloud Deployment (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Deploy to cloud
runagent deploy .

# Deploy to staging environment
runagent deploy . --env staging

# Skip validation checks
runagent deploy . --no-validate
```

## Deployment Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validation">
    - Checks `runagent.config.json`
    - Validates entrypoints
    - Verifies dependencies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Packaging">
    - Bundles agent code
    - Includes dependencies
    - Excludes unnecessary files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    - Uploads to RunAgent servers
    - Or creates local deployment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialization">
    - Starts agent container
    - Configures environment
    - Runs health checks
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Output

Successful deployment shows:

```

Deployment successful!
Agent ID: 055b73d7-6239-4a94-a156-1193fcf33ff0
Status: Running
Endpoint: https://api.run-agent.ai/agents/055b73d7

To test your agent:
  runagent run 055b73d7 --input '{"query": "test"}'
```

## Local Deployment Details

Local deployments:
- Run in Docker containers
- Persist between restarts
- Support multiple versions
- Include local monitoring

```bash
# List local deployments
runagent list --local

# View deployment details
runagent status <deployment-id>
```

## Configuration

### Deployment Settings

In `runagent.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "memory": "512MB",
    "timeout": 30,
    "min_instances": 1,
    "max_instances": 10,
    "environment_variables": {
      "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
    }
  }
}
```

### Excluded Files

By default, these are excluded:
- `.git/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `*.pyc`
- `.env`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`

Create `.deployignore` to customize:

```
# Custom exclusions
*.log
temp/
scratch.py
```

## Validation Checks

Before deployment, RunAgent validates:

<Checklist>
  - Configuration file is valid JSON
  - Required fields are present
  - Entrypoints can be imported
  - Dependencies can be resolved
  - No syntax errors in Python files
  - Environment variables are defined
</Checklist>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Validation Failures">
    ```bash
    # Run validation separately
    runagent validate .
    
    # See detailed errors
    runagent deploy . --log-level debug
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload Failures">
    Check:
    - Internet connection
    - API key is valid
    - File sizes (limit: 50MB)
    - Disk space available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deployment Stuck">
    ```bash
    # Check deployment status
    runagent status <deployment-id>
    
    # View logs
    runagent logs <deployment-id>
    
    # Force restart
    runagent restart <deployment-id>
    ```
  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

1. **Test Locally First**: Always use `runagent serve` before deploying
2. **Use Environments**: Deploy to staging before production
3. **Version Your Agents**: Update version in config for each deployment
4. **Monitor Deployments**: Check logs and metrics after deploying
