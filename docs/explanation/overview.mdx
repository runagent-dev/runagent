> Understanding the "why" and "how" behind RunAgent. These pages explain the concepts, architecture, and design decisions that make RunAgent work.

## What's in This Section?

The Explanation section contains **theory-first, diagram-rich pages** that dive deep into how RunAgent works. Unlike tutorials (which show you how to do things) or how-tos (which solve specific problems), these pages explain the underlying concepts and architecture.

<Tip>
**Keep theory here.** Tutorials and how-tos should only include brief callouts. This section is for deep dives into concepts and architecture.
