## Capabilities at a Glance

| Feature | What It Enables |
|---|---|
| **Sandboxed MicroVMs** | Each agent runs in isolation (Firecracker-based), for security and containment |
| **Autoscaling & Concurrency** | RunAgent scales agents automatically under load, handles cold starts |
| **Streaming Token Responses** | Clients receive tokens as they are generated â€” ideal for chat UIs |
| **Cross-Language Access** | Call the same agent from JS, Go, Python, Rust without extra infra |
| **State & Memory** *(coming soon)* | Agents can optionally hold memory across calls for richer behavior |
| **Security & Auth** *(in progress)* | Agent-scoped API keys, role scopes, sandbox limits |
| **Telemetry & Observability** *(future)* | Logs, metrics, traces to monitor latency, errors, usage |
| **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** *(vision)* | Agents can call and coordinate with other agents |
| **Versioning, Rollbacks, Rate Limits** *(roadmap)* | Control agent versions, limit usage, revert if needed |

## How It Works (High Level)

1. **Write an agent** (one Python function with entrypoint configuration)  
2. **Deploy to microVMs** â€” RunAgent handles sandboxing + autoscaling  
3. **Call via SDK / REST / WS** â€” streaming, sync calls, multi-language  
4. **Monitor & scale** â€” logs, metrics, retries, rate limits  
5. **Iterate & evolve** â€” new versions, memory, agent communication
