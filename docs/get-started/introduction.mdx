RunAgent is an **AI Agent Deployment Platform**, built for builders who are **using AI agents to empower/enhance their products**. From development to deployment, RunAgent enables the developer to fully focus on actual agent development, and not care about:

- Deploying AI Agents with powerful **RunAgent CLI** with a simple configuration file.
- Spinning up a configurable **REST-API and WebSocket server** for your agents with one cli command.
- **Langugae SDK's** for most major languages, to use the deployed agents.

As a result you, the developer gets the freedom to:

* Focus on the agent development and **avoid repeatative process** of implementing REST and Streaming API to use the agents through.
* Use their developed agent in **any devlopment environment**(Web App, Mobile or Desktop App, Games)
* Build application with **cross language response streaming**, without even thinking about the complex underlying serialization & deserialization logic.


## The Problem Every AI Developer Faces

Suppose, You've built an incredible AI agent in Python. It uses **LangGraph for complex reasoning**, leverages **powerful tools**, and produces **amazing results**. Your team loves it!

### Then reality hits:

Your whole team is excited use it! But the **frontend team** needs to access it in JavaScript, your **mobile app team** wants it in Kotlin, your **Unity team** wants it in good old C#, your **systems team** requires it in Rust. 

### The traditional approach?
Build separate implementations, REST APIs, WebSocket handlers...

<Danger>**Sound exhausting?** That's because it is!</Danger>

## What RunAgent Actually Does

RunAgent fundamentally changes how AI agents deployemnt work. Your Python function signatures automatically become API contracts(REST or Streaming) for every supported language.

<Tip>Once `runagent.config.json` of you project  points to your Python function, they are automaically converted to corresponding API endpoints, and all language SDKs automatically adapt. No API versioning, no breaking changes.   </Tip>

The fastest way to experience the magic is with **RunAgent CLI**:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install the RunAgent CLI">
  This installs the powerful RunAgent CLI, which is used to deploy and manage your agents.
   ```bash
   pip install runagent
   ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Agent">

  Lets start with our minimal Agent example.
  ```bash
  runagent init my_agent
  cd my_agent
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setting Up RunAgent config file">
  Somewhere in your Agent codebase(in this case `main.py`)
  ```python main.py icon="python"
def mock_response(message, role="user"):
    """Test the mock agent with non-streaming responses"""
    ...
    return response.content
  ```
  This `mock_response` function is one of the invocation functions for our agent, so we will add this in `runagent.config.json` file:
  ```json
"entrypoints": [
    {
      "file": "main.py",
      "module": "mock_response",
      "tag": "minimal"
    }
]
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Agent (Locally)">
  ```bash
runagent serve .
```

And you will see output similar to:
```bash
ü§ñ Agent Details:
- Agent ID: f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- Port: 8451
- Framework: default
- Status: ready

üåê Server running at: http://127.0.0.1:8451
üìñ API Documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8451/docs

üìç Available endpoints:
- POST /api/v1/agents/.../execute/minimal - Run your agent

INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8451 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  ```
  That's it, your agent is running, and is accessible through standard REST-api as well as all RunAgent SDKs.
  </Step>

<Step title="Use in your application">
Using the RunAgent SDKs, you can use your agent in your application, only using the agent ID and the entrypoint tag. Your agentic entrypoint(`mock_response` function) now becomes accessible in:
<CodeGroup>


```python Python 
from runagent import RunAgentClient

ra = RunAgentClient(
    agent_id="f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce",
    entrypoint_tag="minimal",
    local=True
)

agent_result = ra.run(
    role="user",
    message="Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams"
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { RunAgentClient } from 'runagent';

const ra = new RunAgentClient({
  agentId: 'f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce',
  entrypointTag: 'minimal',
  local: true,
});

const analysis = await client.run({
    role: "user",
    message: "Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams"
});
```

```rust Rust  
use runagent::client::RunAgentClient;
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = RunAgentClient::new("f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce", "minimal", true).await?;
    
    let response = client.run(&[
        ("role", json!("user")),
        ("message", json!("Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams"))
    ]).await?;
    
    println!("Response: {}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

```go Go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/runagent-dev/runagent-go/pkg/client"
)

func main() {
	agentClient, err := client.NewWithAddress(
		"f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce",
		"minimal",
		true,
		"localhost",
		8453,
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v", err)
	}
	defer agentClient.Close()

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Minute)
	defer cancel()

	result, err := agentClient.Run(ctx, map[string]interface{}{
		"message": "Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams",
		"role": "user",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to run agent: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Result: %v\n", result)
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-Time Streaming Across Languages

In addition to REST api like responses, you can also stream your agent response super-easily through our SDKs. 

When your targeted entrypoint streams response, RunAgent makes it feel native in every language SDK:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Setting Up RunAgent config file">

  Somewhere an Iterator in your Agent codebase(in this case `main.py`)

  ```python main.py icon="python"
def mock_response_stream(message, role="user") -> Iterator[str]:
    """Test the mock agent with streaming responses"""
    ...
    return response.content
  ```
  This `mock_response_stream` function will return an Iterator, and to stream this response, we will add this in `runagent.config.json` file, as anotehr entrypoint:
  ```json
"entrypoints": [
    {
      "file": "main.py",
      "module": "mock_response_stream",
      "tag": "minimal_stream"
    }
]
  ```
  <Note> The tag for a Streaming Entrypoint must end with a `_stream` suffix. That is how RunAgent identifies it for streaming.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Agent (Locally)">
  Spin up the agent just like we did before. But now we have an additional streaming entrypoint.
  ```bash
runagent serve .
```

  </Step>

<Step title="Use streaming in your application">
Using the RunAgent SDKs, you can use your agent in your application, only using the agent ID and the entrypoint tag. Your agentic entrypoint(`mock_response` function) now becomes accessible in:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python 
from runagent import RunAgentClient

ra = RunAgentClient(
    agent_id="f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce",
    entrypoint_tag="minimal_stream",
    local=True
)

for chunk in ra.run(
  role = "user",
  content = "Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams"
):
    print(chunk)

```


```javascript JavaScript
import { RunAgentClient } from 'runagent';

const client = new RunAgentClient({
    agentId: 'f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce',
    entrypointTag: 'report_gen_streaming',
    local: true
});

await client.initialize();

const stream = await client.runStream({topic: "AI Market Trends"});
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    document.getElementById('report').innerHTML += chunk;
}
```

```rust Rust  
use runagent::client::RunAgentClient;
use serde_json::json;
use futures::StreamExt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = RunAgentClient::new("f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce", "report_gen_streaming", true).await?;
    
    let mut stream = client.run_stream(&[("topic", json!("AI Market"))]).await?;
    while let Some(chunk) = stream.next().await {
        print!("{}", chunk?);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

```go Go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/runagent-dev/runagent/runagent-go/runagent"
)

func main() {
    client := runagent.NewRunAgentClient(runagent.Config{
        AgentID:       "f7066c98-0eb2-488c-bb37-a869a93d51ce",
        EntrypointTag: "report_gen_streaming",
        Local:         true,
    })
    
    ctx := context.Background()
    client.Initialize(ctx)
    
    s, err := client.RunStream(ctx, map[string]interface{}{
		    "role":    "user",
		    "message": "Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer s.Close()

    for {
        data, hasMore, err := s.Next(ctx)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        if !hasMore {
            break
        }
        fmt.Printf("%v", data)
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
