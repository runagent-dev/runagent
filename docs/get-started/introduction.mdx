Write your AI agents once in Python. Use them everywhere, from any programming language, with zero infrastructure complexity.

## The Problem Every AI Developer Faces

You've built an incredible AI agent in Python. It uses LangGraph for complex reasoning, leverages powerful tools, and produces amazing results. Your team loves it.

**Then reality hits:**

Your **frontend team** needs it in JavaScript, your **mobile team** wants it in Kotlin, your **Unity team** wants it in good old C#, your **systems team** requires it in Rust. The traditional approach? Build separate implementations, REST APIs, WebSocket handlers...

**Sound exhausting?** That's because it is.

## What RunAgent Actually Does

RunAgent fundamentally changes how AI agents work. Here's the magic:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/runagent_dia_light.jpg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/runagent_dia_dark.jpg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>


Your Python function signatures automatically become API contracts for every supported language:

<CodeGroup>
```python Your Python Agent
def analyze_market(company: str, timeframe: str = "1year") -> dict:
    return langgraph_agent.invoke({"company": company, "timeframe": timeframe})
```

```javascript Becomes JavaScript
const analysis = await client.run({
    company: "Tesla",
    timeframe: "6months"
});
```

```rust Becomes Rust  
let analysis = client.run(&[
    ("company", json!("Tesla")),
    ("timeframe", json!("6months"))
]).await?;
```
</CodeGroup>

**The Revolutionary Insight**: Change your Python function signature, and all language SDKs automatically adapt. No API versioning, no breaking changes.

## Getting started

The fastest way to experience the magic is with RunAgent:

1. **Install the CLI** (includes Python SDK):
   ```bash
   pip install runagent
   ```

2. **Create your first agent**:
   ```bash
   runagent init my_agent
   ```

3. **Deploy locally**:
   ```bash
   runagent serve my_agent
   ```

...and you're ready to access your Python agent from any supported language.

## Real-Time Streaming Across Languages

When your Python agent streams responses, RunAgent makes it feel native in every target language:

  <Tab title="Python Generator">
    ```python
    def generate_report(topic: str) -> Iterator[str]:
        yield f"# {topic} Analysis Report\n\n"
        yield "## Executive Summary\n"
        for section in analyze_topic(topic):
            yield f"### {section.title}\n{section.content}\n\n"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JavaScript Async Iterator">
    ```javascript
    const stream = await client.runStream({topic: "AI Market Trends"});
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        document.getElementById('report').innerHTML += chunk;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Rust Futures Stream">
    ```rust
    let mut stream = client.run_stream(&[("topic", json!("AI Market"))]).await?;
    while let Some(chunk) = stream.next().await {
        println!("{}", chunk?);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**What's happening**: WebSocket connections, real-time data flow, and native iteration patterns—all handled automatically by RunAgent.
