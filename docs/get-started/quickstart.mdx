## The Magic You're About to Experience

In the next 5 minutes, you'll:
1. **Deploy a Python agent** that responds intelligently to questions
2. **Call it from multiple languages** like it's a native function
3. **Stream responses in real-time** across language boundaries
4. **Understand why** this changes everything for AI development

Ready? Let's make some magic happen ‚ú®

## Installation: Your Gateway to Multi-Language AI

Install RunAgent CLI (includes Python SDK):

```bash
pip install runagent
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
runagent --version
```

<Note>
**What just happened?** You now have both a powerful CLI for deploying agents AND a Python SDK for accessing them. Two tools, one install!
</Note>

## Create Your First Agent: From Zero to Intelligence

Let's create a simple but intelligent agent that demonstrates RunAgent's core superpower:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the Magic">
    ```bash
    runagent init my_agent
    cd my_agent
    ```
    
    **What RunAgent just created for you:**
    ```
    my_agent/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                # Your agent's brain (two smart functions)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email_agent.py         # Mock AI client (no API keys needed!)  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runagent.config.json   # The bridge to other languages
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py            # Python package magic
    ```
    
    <Note>
      **Pro insight**: This isn't just boilerplate. Each file serves a specific purpose in making your Python agent accessible from any programming language.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Peek Under the Hood: See Your Agent's Brain">
    Your agent has two functions that will become universally accessible APIs:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Non-streaming Intelligence
    def mock_response(message, role="user"):
        """Your agent's instant-response mode"""
        client = MockOpenAIClient()

        prompt = [{"role": role, "content": message}]
        response = client.create(model="gpt-4", messages=prompt)

        print(f"Tokens used: {response.usage_tokens}")
        print(f"Response time: {response.response_time:.2f}s")

        return response.content  # Complete response, all at once
    ```
    
    ```python Streaming Intelligence
    def mock_response_stream(message, role="user") -> Iterator[str]:
        """Your agent's real-time streaming mode"""
        client = MockOpenAIClient()
        prompt = [{"role": role, "content": message}]
        
        for chunk in client.create(model="gpt-4", messages=prompt, stream=True):
            if not chunk.finished:
                yield chunk.delta  # Stream words as they're "generated"
            else:
                yield "\n[STREAM COMPLETE]"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    **The "Aha!" Moment**: These Python functions accept `message` and `role` parameters. That's exactly what you'll pass from JavaScript, Rust, or any other language‚ÄîRunAgent handles the translation!
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="The Configuration Bridge">
    Open `runagent.config.json` to see how Python functions become universal APIs:
    
    ```json
    {
      "agent_name": "my-agent",
      "description": "A simple placeholder agent",
      "framework": "default",
      "agent_architecture": {
        "entrypoints": [
          {
            "file": "main.py",
            "module": "mock_response", 
            "tag": "minimal"
          },
          {
            "file": "main.py",
            "module": "mock_response_stream",
            "tag": "minimal_stream"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **What this means**: 
    - Your `mock_response` function becomes accessible via the `minimal` tag
    - Your streaming function gets the `minimal_stream` tag (note the `_stream` suffix!)
    - Any language can now call these functions by their tags
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate Your Agent">
    Launch your agent into the RunAgent universe:
    
    ```bash
    runagent serve .
    ```
    
    **You'll see magic happen:**
    ```
    üöÄ Agent Starting...
    üì¶ Agent ID: agent_abc123
    üåê Server running at: http://localhost:8000
    ‚úÖ Agent ready for multi-language access!
    ```
    
    **Critical insight**: That `agent_id` is your agent's universal address. Any programming language can now connect to your Python intelligence using this ID!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Multi-Language Magic: Same Agent, Every Language

Now comes the mind-blowing part. Your Python agent is now accessible from any supported language as if it were written natively in that language.

### Standard Responses: Get Complete Intelligence

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="üî• CLI - Zero Code Testing">
    The fastest way to prove the magic works:
    ```bash
    runagent run --id agent_abc123 --local --tag minimal \
      --message "Explain why the sky is blue" \
      --role user
    ```
    
    **Live output:**
    ```
    üöÄ RunAgent Configuration:
       Agent ID: agent_abc123
       Tag: minimal
       Local: Yes
    üîç Auto-resolved address: 127.0.0.1:8000
    ü§ñ Executing agent: agent_abc123
    ‚úÖ Agent execution completed!
    
    The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering...
    ```
    
    **What just happened?** You called your Python function from the command line with zero setup!
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="üêç Python SDK - Native Feel">
    ```python
    from runagent import RunAgentClient
    
    # Connect to your agent (replace with your actual agent_id)
    ra = RunAgentClient(
        agent_id="agent_abc123",
        entrypoint_tag="minimal",
        local=True
    )
    
    # Call your agent like it's a local function
    result = ra.run(
        message="Analyze the benefits of remote work for software teams",
        role="user"
    )
    print(result)
    ```
    
    **The magic**: This feels like calling a local Python function, but it's actually making network calls to your deployed agent!
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="üü® JavaScript SDK - Promise Paradise">
    First, install in your JS project:
    ```bash
    npm install runagent
    ```
    
    Then use your Python agent from JavaScript:
    ```javascript
    import { RunAgentClient } from 'runagent';
    
    const ra = new RunAgentClient({
      agentId: "agent_abc123",
      entrypointTag: "minimal", 
      local: true
    });
    
    await ra.initialize();
    
    const result = await ra.run({
      message: 'What makes a great engineering team?',
      role: 'user'
    });
    
    console.log(result);
    ```
    
    **Mind-bending reality**: JavaScript developers are now calling your Python AI agent as if it were native JavaScript code!
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="üîó Connection Flexibility">
    You can connect using the server URL instead of agent_id:
    ```python
    from runagent import RunAgentClient
    
    ra = RunAgentClient(
        host="localhost",
        port=8000,
        entrypoint_tag="minimal",
        local=True
    )
    
    result = ra.run(message="Hello from any language!")
    print(result)
    ```
    
    **Why this matters**: You can deploy to any server and connect from anywhere!

      local: true
    });
    
    await ra.initialize();
    
    const stream = await ra.run({
      message: 'Write a poem about coding'
    });
    
    // Modern JavaScript async iteration
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
    }

## Understanding the Universal Entrypoint System

This is the core concept that makes RunAgent revolutionary:

### How Function Signatures Become Universal APIs

```mermaid
graph TD
    FUNC[Python Function<br/>def my_agent query mode]
    CONFIG[runagent.config.json<br/>Maps function to tag]
    ROUTER[RunAgent Router<br/>Universal API Gateway]
    
    PY[Python SDK<br/>client.run query mode]
    JS[JavaScript SDK<br/>client.run object]
    RS[Rust SDK<br/>client.run array]
    
    FUNC --> CONFIG
    CONFIG --> ROUTER
    ROUTER --> PY
    ROUTER --> JS
    ROUTER --> RS
    
    style FUNC fill:#e8f5e8
    style ROUTER fill:#f0f8ff
    style PY fill:#ffe8cc
    style JS fill:#fff9cc
    style RS fill:#ffe8e8
```

**The Revolutionary Insight**: Your Python function signature automatically defines the API contract for all programming languages. Change the Python function, and all language SDKs automatically adapt!

### Streaming: The Real-Time Superpower

When you use `Iterator[str]` in Python, RunAgent automatically:
- üîÑ **Establishes WebSocket connections** for real-time data flow
- üì° **Streams chunks immediately** as your function yields them
- üåê **Provides native iteration patterns** in each target language
- ‚úÖ **Handles connection lifecycle** and error recovery

```python
# Your Python generator
def generate_report(topic: str) -> Iterator[str]:
    yield "# Report: " + topic + "\n\n"
    yield "## Introduction\n"
    # ... more yields
    
# Becomes JavaScript async iterator
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    document.body.innerHTML += chunk;
}

# Becomes Rust futures stream  
while let Some(chunk) = stream.next().await {
    println!("{}", chunk?);
}
```

## Common Questions from New Users

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I connect to my agent?">
    **Most common fix**: Make sure your agent is still running:
    ```bash
    runagent serve .  # Keep this running in one terminal
    ```
    Then use the SDK in another terminal or Python script. The agent needs to stay active to receive requests!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My entrypoint tag isn't found">
    **Check your configuration**: The tag in your SDK call must exactly match what's in `runagent.config.json`:
    ```bash
    cat runagent.config.json | grep -A 5 "entrypoints"
    ```
    Remember: streaming tags must end with `_stream`!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I get import errors with framework templates">
    **Install the dependencies**: Framework templates come with requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # For LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Port 8000 is already in use">
    **Use a different port**:
    ```bash
    runagent serve . --port 8080
    ```
    Then connect using `port=8080` in your SDK calls.
  </Accordion>
