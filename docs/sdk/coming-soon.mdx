## SDKs in Development

We're actively working on native SDKs for additional programming languages. Each SDK will provide the same powerful features as our Python SDK while following language-specific best practices.

## JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

<Card title="JavaScript SDK" icon="js">
  
  The JavaScript SDK will support both Node.js and browser environments with full TypeScript support.
  
  ### Planned Features
  - Promise-based and async/await APIs
  - Real-time streaming with EventSource
  - TypeScript type definitions
  - React hooks for easy integration
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
  
  ### Preview
  ```typescript
  import { RunAgentClient } from '@runagent/sdk';
  
  const client = new RunAgentClient({
    agentId: 'your-agent-id',
    apiKey: process.env.RUNAGENT_API_KEY
  });
  
  // Async/await
  const result = await client.runGeneric({
    query: 'Hello, agent!'
  });
  
  // Streaming
  const stream = client.streamGeneric({ query: 'Tell me a story' });
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    console.log(chunk);
  }
  ```

## Go SDK

<Card title="Go SDK" icon="golang">  
  Idiomatic Go client with excellent concurrency support.
  
  ### Planned Features
  - Context-based cancellation
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Efficient connection reuse
  - Structured logging support
  - Middleware for customization
  
  ### Preview
  ```go
  package main
  
  import (
      "context"
      "fmt"
      "github.com/runagent-dev/runagent-go"
  )
  
  func main() {
      client := runagent.NewClient("your-agent-id").
          WithAPIKey("your-api-key")
      
      ctx := context.Background()
      resp, err := client.RunGeneric(ctx, runagent.Input{
          Query: "Hello, agent!",
      })
      
      if err != nil {
          panic(err)
      }
      
      fmt.Printf("Response: %v\n", resp)
  }
  ```

## Community SDKs

Building an SDK for another language? We'd love to support you!

### Guidelines for Community SDKs

1. **Follow API conventions** - Use consistent method names
2. **Implement core features** - Auth, sync/async, streaming
3. **Add tests** - Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Document thoroughly** - Examples and API reference
5. **Open source** - Share with the community

### Get Featured

High-quality community SDKs can become official:
- Code review by our team
- Integration into our CI/CD
- Official documentation
- Ongoing maintenance support
