## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install RunAgent?">
    Simply use pip:
    ```bash
    pip install runagent
    ```
    
    For development with all dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install "runagent[dev]"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to rewrite my existing agent?">
    No! RunAgent works with your existing code. Just:
    1. Add a `runagent.config.json` file
    2. Define your entrypoints
    3. Deploy
    
    Your agent logic remains unchanged.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are entrypoints?">
    Entrypoints are functions RunAgent calls to interact with your agent:
    
    ```python
    # Standard entrypoint
    def invoke(input_data: dict) -> dict:
        return {"result": "processed"}
    
    # Streaming entrypoint
    def stream(input_data: dict):
        for chunk in process():
            yield chunk
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Python versions are supported?">
    RunAgent supports Python 3.8 and above:
    - Python 3.8
    - Python 3.9
    - Python 3.10
    - Python 3.11
    - Python 3.12
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use custom dependencies?">
    Yes! Add any dependencies to your `requirements.txt`:
    ```txt
    openai>=1.0.0
    requests>=2.31.0
    pandas>=2.0.0
    your-custom-package>=1.0.0
    ```
    
    RunAgent will install them during deployment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle secrets and API keys?">
    **Local development**: Use `.env` files
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
    ```
    
    **Production**: Set in deployment configuration
    ```bash
    runagent deploy . --env OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```
    
    Secrets are encrypted at rest and never logged.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are the resource limits?">
    **Default limits**:
    - Memory: 512MB (configurable up to 8GB)
    - Timeout: 30 seconds (configurable up to 900s)
    - Payload size: 10MB
    - Concurrent requests: Based on plan
    
    Configure in `runagent.config.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "deployment": {
        "memory": "2GB",
        "timeout": 120
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between local and cloud deployment?">
    **Local deployment**:
    - Runs on your machine
    - Free forever
    - Good for development and testing
    - Requires your machine to be running
    
    **Cloud deployment**:
    - Runs on RunAgent infrastructure
    - Auto-scaling and high availability
    - Monitoring and logging included
    - Accessible from anywhere
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I update a deployed agent?">
    Simply deploy again with the same name:
    ```bash
    # Updates existing deployment
    runagent deploy . --name my-agent
    ```
    
    RunAgent handles:
    - Zero-downtime updates
    - Automatic rollback on failure
    - Version history
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy multiple versions?">
    Yes! Use different names or environments:
    ```bash
    # Production version
    runagent deploy . --name agent-prod --env production
    
    # Staging version
    runagent deploy . --name agent-staging --env staging
    
    # Development version
    runagent deploy . --name agent-dev --env development
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SDK Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which languages have SDKs?">
    **Available now**:
    - Python
    
    **Coming soon**:
    - JavaScript/TypeScript (Q2 2024)
    - Rust (Q2 2024)
    - Go (Q3 2024)
    
    You can always use the REST API directly from any language.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle streaming responses?">
    **Python SDK**:
    ```python
    for chunk in client.run_generic_stream(input_data):
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
    ```
    
    **Direct API**:
    Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) with appropriate client library.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is the SDK thread-safe?">
    Yes, the SDK clients are thread-safe. You can:
    - Share a client instance across threads
    - Use in async contexts with AsyncRunAgentClient
    - Handle concurrent requests
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My agent works locally but fails when deployed">
    Common causes:
    1. **Missing environment variables** - Check all are set
    2. **File path issues** - Use relative paths
    3. **Dependency versions** - Pin specific versions
    4. **Resource limits** - Increase memory/timeout
    
    Debug with:
    ```bash
    runagent logs <deployment-id>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I debug performance issues?">
    1. **Add logging** to identify slow operations
    2. **Use profiling** to find bottlenecks
    3. **Check logs** for errors or warnings
    4. **Monitor metrics** (coming soon)
    
    ```python
    import time
    start = time.time()
    # operation
    print(f"Took {time.time() - start}s")
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How should I structure my agent project?">
    Recommended structure:
    ```
    my-agent/
    ├── agent.py           # Main agent code
    ├── utils/             # Helper functions
    ├── prompts/           # Prompt templates
    ├── tests/             # Unit tests
    ├── runagent.config.json
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── .env.example
    └── README.md
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I use sync or async?">
    **Use sync when**:
    - Simple request/response
    - No concurrent operations
    - Easier to debug
    
    **Use async when**:
    - Multiple API calls
    - I/O intensive operations
    - Need better performance
  </Accordion>
