## Welcome to RunAgent

RunAgent is a unified platform for deploying, managing, and scaling AI agentsâ€”no matter which framework you use. Whether your agent is built with LangGraph, CrewAI, Agno, Letta, or any other framework, RunAgent provides the infrastructure and tools to take it from development to production seamlessly.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Your Project">
    Create a new agent project or adapt your existing code
    ```bash
    runagent init my-agent --framework langgraph
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Agent">
    Define entrypoints and settings in `runagent.config.json`
    ```json
    {
      "agent_name": "my-agent",
      "framework": "langgraph",
      "entrypoints": [...]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Locally">
    Run your agent locally with hot reload
    ```bash
    runagent serve .
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Production">
    Deploy to our managed infrastructure (coming soon)
    ```bash
    runagent deploy .
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Universal Framework Support">
    Deploy agents built with any major framework without changing your code. RunAgent handles the infrastructure complexity while preserving your agent's logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response Streaming">
    Built-in support for streaming responses, perfect for chatbots and real-time applications. Both synchronous and asynchronous streaming are supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secure Execution">
    Agents run in sandboxed environments with resource isolation. Your code and data remain secure and separate from other deployments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Language SDKs">
    Interact with your agents using our Python SDK (available now) or upcoming JavaScript, Rust, and Go SDKs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how easy it is to deploy and use an agent:

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Initialize a new agent
runagent init problem-solver --framework langgraph

# Test locally
runagent serve .

# Deploy (coming soon)
runagent deploy .
```

```python Python SDK
from runagent import RunAgentClient

# Connect to your agent
client = RunAgentClient(agent_id="your-agent-id")

# Run synchronously
result = client.run_generic({
    "query": "Help me solve this problem",
    "context": "I need to optimize my code"
})

# Or stream responses
for chunk in client.run_generic_stream({"query": "Explain quantum computing"}):
    print(chunk, end="")
```
