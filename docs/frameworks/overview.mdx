## Supported Frameworks

RunAgent is designed to work with any AI agent framework. We provide first-class support for popular frameworks while allowing custom implementations.

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | Key Features | Learning Curve |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| LangGraph | Complex workflows | State machines, cycles | Medium |
| CrewAI | Multi-agent systems | Role assignment, delegation | Low |
| Agno | Reasoning tasks | Memory, planning | Medium |
| Letta | Conversations | Context retention | Low |
| Custom | Specific needs | Full control | Varies |

## Choosing a Framework

### LangGraph
Choose LangGraph when you need:
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Conditional branching
- State management
- Cycles and loops in agent logic

### CrewAI
Choose CrewAI when you need:
- Multiple specialized agents
- Task delegation
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Role-based agent design

### Agno
Choose Agno when you need:
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Built-in memory systems
- Planning and goal-setting
- Adaptive behavior

### Letta
Choose Letta when you need:
- Long-running conversations
- Personality consistency
- Memory across sessions
- Natural dialogue flow

### Custom Framework
Choose custom when you need:
- Specific requirements not met by others
- Integration with proprietary systems
- Maximum performance optimization
- Complete control over implementation

## Quick Start Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LangGraph">
    ```bash
    runagent init my-agent --framework langgraph
    cd my-agent
    # Edit agents.py with your LangGraph logic
    runagent serve .
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CrewAI">
    ```bash
    runagent init my-crew --framework crewai
    cd my-crew
    # Define your crew in crew.py
    runagent serve .
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom">
    ```bash
    runagent init my-custom --framework custom
    cd my-custom
    # Implement your agent logic
    runagent serve .
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Framework Integration

All frameworks integrate with RunAgent through:

1. **Standardized Entrypoints**: Define how to invoke your agent
2. **Configuration**: Specify framework in `runagent.config.json`
3. **Environment Management**: Handle API keys and settings
4. **Deployment**: Same process regardless of framework

## Best Practices by Framework

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LangGraph Best Practices">
    - Keep graphs simple and readable
    - Use appropriate state persistence
    - Handle edge cases in transitions
    - Test each node independently
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CrewAI Best Practices">
    - Define clear agent roles
    - Minimize agent dependencies
    - Use appropriate delegation patterns
    - Monitor inter-agent communication
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Framework Best Practices">
    - Follow RunAgent conventions
    - Implement proper error handling
    - Document your approach
    - Consider open-sourcing if general-purpose
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Considerations

| Framework | Memory Usage | Latency | Scalability |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| LangGraph | Medium | Low | High |
| CrewAI | High | Medium | Medium |
| Agno | Medium | Medium | High |
| Letta | Low | Low | High |
| Custom | Varies | Varies | Varies |

## Migration Between Frameworks

RunAgent makes it easy to switch frameworks:

1. **Keep business logic separate** from framework code
2. **Use consistent interfaces** for inputs/outputs
3. **Test thoroughly** after migration
4. **Update configuration** in `runagent.config.json`

## Community Frameworks

We're always adding support for new frameworks. Coming soon:
- AutoGen
- BabyAGI
- AgentGPT
- Custom community frameworks
